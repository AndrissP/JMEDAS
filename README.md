# Jet CMS DAS Exercise

## CMS DAS June  2023
  
### Introduction
This tutorial is intended to provide you with the basic you need in order to deal with jets in your analysis. We start with the basics of what is a jet, how are they reconstructed, what algorithms are used, etc. Then we give examples with scripts on how to access jets and use them in your analysis frameworks, including corrections and systematics. In the second part of the exercise, we examine jet substructure algorithms, which have many uses including identification of hadronic decays of heavy SM particles like top quarks, W, Z, and H bosons, as well as mitigation of pileup and others.

This tutorial is designed to be executed as notebooks in SWAN. Also script based versions of the
exercises are provided, which can be executed in lxplus.

## Slides
At the exercise session, we will cover the short version of the slides [CMSDAS_Jets_intro_2023.pdf](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/SWGuideCMSDataAnalysisSchoolLPC2023JetExercise/CMSDAS_Jets_intro_2023.pdf).
A longer version of the slides is also provided [CMSDAS_Jets_intro_2023_longer.pdf](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TKgKRX_BV885NoKyxCdbFZKEjYn_IG5TDsZp9IYgPQk/edit#slide=id.p1).

## Run exercises in SWAN
This version of the same tutorial uses Jupyer Notebooks as a browser-based development environment at [CERN-SWAN](https://swan.cern.ch/) the content of these notebooks is the same as the one in lxplus, it is just a different set up.

### Setup
Go to [https://swan.cern.ch](https://swan.cern.ch) and log in with your CERN account. After that you need to configure your environment, please use these settings:

The most important configuration is the software stack, which has to be ```97a Python2```. After that click on start the session.
Once you are in ```My Projects```, create a new project by clicking on the plus icon on the right part of ```My Projects```. Enter the project name you like, for this example we will use CMSDAS_jetExercise.

## Checkout the code
Open up a terminal by clicking on the icon:

Once there, you are in your cernbox home area, and you can follow these steps:

```
cd SWAN_projects/CMSDAS_jetExercise/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-jet/JMEDAS/DASJan2022/setup-libraries_SWAN.sh
source setup-libraries_SWAN.sh 
```
This will take a while, but basically you are setting your CMSSW environment, cloning some packages, and creating the kernel used in this exercises. If the compilation is succesful, you should see something similar to this at the end of the messages:

```
Loaded CMSSW_10_6_6 into hats-jec!
```

After this you can go to ```~/CMSDAS_jetExercise/DAS/``` and continue with the tutorial. 
The previous steps you have to do it once. Additionally, two important things:

-You need to follow the instructions below to set your grid certificate.
-If you try to access any of the notebooks any other day, it will require you to confirm the kernel. For that please select the ```hats-jec``` option.

### Tutorial
Once you've completed the setup instructions, change to the directory ```~/SWAN_projects/CMSDAS_jetExercise/DAS/``` in SWAN. Information on the separate tutorial can be found in the "notebooks" subdirectory.


## Run exercises in lxplus

Open a terminal/console, connect to lxplus and prepare your working area (instructions are in bash shell syntax):

```
ssh -Y <username>@lxplus.cern.ch
mkdir JMEDAS2023
cd JMEDAS2023

export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
scramv1 -n CMSSW10618_JMEDAS  CMSSW_10_6_18   ### choose an appropriate directory name instead of `CMSSW10618_JMEDAS`
cd CMSSW_10_6_18/src
cmsenv

git clone https://github.com/AndrissP/JMEDAS.git Analysis/JMEDAS
git clone https://github.com/cms-jet/JetToolbox Analysis/JetToolbox -b jetToolbox_102X_v3
cd Analysis/JMEDAS
scram b -j 4
```

In some exercises we also need to access files in remote servers, so activate your grid certificate:
```
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00
```

If you like seeing your working directory in the commandline, you can do also this by adding a line to ~/.bashrc and activating it with the 'source' command:

```
echo "PS1='\W\$ '" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can go back to the TWiki page and start with the basics in Section 1.
